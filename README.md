# aaliyah

Aaaliyah is a cutting edge JavaScript library with an upbeat attitude:

Sometimes if your code doesn't work, you just have to [try again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi_lhIaZOXI).

## Install

```npm install aaliyah```

## Usage

```
aliyaah = require("aaliyah");

aliyaah.tryAgain(function() {
    console.log(x); //not defined (not to be confused with undefined)
}, 100);

setTimeout(function() {
    x = "Successfully dusted it off and tried again. Now it works!"
}, 500);
```
